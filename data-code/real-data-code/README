# 1. Workflow for Obtaining Empirical Figures in the Paper

(1) Figure 1 and 2 in the paper
   (a) Open the folder named "real-data-code."
   (b) Run the script “MAIN_EST_PLOTS.m” in matlab.

(2) Figure 12 in the supplementary material
   (a) Open the folder named "real-data-code."
   (b) Run the script “MAIN_EST_PLOTS.m” in matlab.

   
# 2. Workflow for Obtaining Empirical Tables in the Paper

(1)Tables 13 in the supplementary material
  (a) Open the folder named "real-data-code."
  (b) Run the script “Main_Summary_Statistics.m” in matlab.
  
(2)Tables 14 in the supplementary material
  (a) Open the folder named "real-data-code."
  (b) Run the scripts “MAIN_EST_PLOTS.m” and “Main_BFK.m” in matlab.
  (c) Obtain the results from "sample10_BFK.mat." The calendar dates corresponding to the numerical break date values can be found in "dates.xlsx."

(3)Table 15 in the supplementary material
  (a) Open the folder named "real-data-code."
  (b) Run the script “MAIN_EST_PLOTS.m” in matlab.
  (c) Summarize the pooled regression results from the table in "sample10_est_all.mat" and the group-specific results from "sample10_est_groupcoeff.mat." The calendar dates corresponding to the numerical break date values can be found in "dates.xlsx."

# 3. Data Dictionary

Column 3: Monthly Dates (in Stata format)
Column 4: Monthly Returns
Column 5: Market Beta
Column 6: Size
Column 7: Book-to-Market Ratio
Column 8: Momentum

(2) SP500.mat
