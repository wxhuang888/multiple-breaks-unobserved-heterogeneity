1. Workflow for Obtaining Simulation Tables/Figures in the Paper(1) Tables 1 and 3 in the paper
   (a) Open the folder named "simulation/Heterogenous Panel"   (b) Run the script “Step1_DGPs_Hetero_DATA_FE_U.m” in matlab
   (c) Run the script “Step2_RUN_ALL_Hetero_U_TwoTunings_N1F.m” in matlab
   (d) Summarize the results obtained in (c)

(2) Tables 2 and 4 in the paper
   (a) Open the folder named "simulation/Group Panel".   (b) Run the script “Step1_DGP_Group_FE_Tdist.m” (for DGPG 1--4) and “Step1_DGP_Group_FE_Tdist_Multi.m” (for DGPG 5) in matlab
   (c) Run the script “Step2_RUN_ALL_Group.m” (for DGPG 1--4) and “Step2_RUN_ALL_Group_Multi.m” (for DGPG 5) in matlab
   (d) Summarize the results obtained in (c)
   2. Workflow for Obtaining Simulation Tables/Figures in the supplementary material
(1) Tables 1--4, 8--9, 10--11 in the supplementary material
   * The results are obtained using the same scripts as for Tables 1 and 3 in the paper with different setups (DGPs, tunings, etc)
   (a) Open the folder named "simulation/Heterogenous Panel"
   (b) Run the script “Step1_DGPs_Hetero_DATA_FE_U.m” in matlab
   (c) Run the script “Step2_RUN_ALL_Hetero_U_TwoTunings_N1F.m” in matlab
   (d) Summarize the results obtained in (c)
(2) Table 12 in the supplementary material
   (a) Open the folder named "simulation/Group Panel"   (b) Run the script “Step1_DGP_Group_FE_Tdist.m” (for DGPG 1--4) in matlab
   (c) Run the script “Step2_RUN_ALL_Group.m” (for DGPG 1--4) in matlab
   (d) Run the script “Step3_RUN_ALL_GroupCoeff_Type123_FE.m” (for DGPG 1--3), “Step3_RUN_ALL_GroupCoeff_Type4_FE.m” (for DGPG 4), and “Step3_RUN_ALL_OracleCoeff_Tdist_FE.m” (for Oracle results) in matlab
   (e) Summarize the results obtained in (d)


(3) Figures 1--2, 8--11 in the supplementary material
   * The value of each dot in the figure summarizes results obtained using the same scripts as for Tables 1 and 3 in the paper (DGPI) and Tables 2 and 4 in the paper (DGPG), with different DGP setups:  
For Figures 1--2, use “Step1_DGPs_Hetero_DATA_FE_U.m” in the folder named "simulation/Heterogenous Panel" with different NF values;
For Figures 8--9, use “Step1_DGP_Group_FE_Tdist_Bfrac.m” in the folder named "simulation/Group Panel";
For Figures 10--11, use “Step1_DGP_Group_FE_Tdist_Multi_BS.m” in the folder named "simulation/Group Panel". 


(4) Figures 3--7, Tables 6--7 in the supplementary material
   * The values summarizes results obtained using replication codes from Qian and Su (2016a), Qian and Su (2016b), Okui and Wang (2021), Lumsdaine, Okui, Wang (2023): 
Unzip the file “reference.zip” in the folder named "simulation/Comparison";
Run the scripts starting with “Step2_RUN_ALL_comp_xxx.m” in the folder named "simulation/Comparison" for different methods. These codes are adapted from the replications codes of Qian and Su (2016a), Qian and Su (2016b), Okui and Wang (2021), and Lumsdaine, Okui, Wang (2023).
